# Static Meter

This shows a meter that is filled by a certain percentage. If you are not
otherwise communicating the percentage filled to the user (e.g. by a text label
nearby), you should add an ARIA label attribute to this component that
includes the percentage, so that assistive technologies can pick it up.
